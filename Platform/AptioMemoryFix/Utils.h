/**
  Convert a Null-terminated Unicode string to a Null-terminated
  ASCII string and returns the ASCII string.
  This function converts the content of the Unicode string Source
  to the ASCII string Destination by copying the lower 8 bits of
  each Unicode character. It returns Destination.
  The caller is responsible to make sure Destination points to a buffer with size
  equal or greater than ((StrLen (Source) + 1) * sizeof (CHAR8)) in bytes.
  The caller is responsible that Source and Destination don't overlap.
  If Destination is NULL, or if Source is NULL, then NULL is returned.
  If DestinationSize is zero, it's a no-op and Destination returned.
  @param  Source           A pointer to a Null-terminated Unicode string.
  @param  Destination      A pointer to a Null-terminated ASCII string.
  @param  DestinationSize  A size of Destination string, including null-terminating char.
  @return Destination.
